# Assortment of projects written in Go

That's exactly what this is.. An assortment of projects written in Go.
Dispersed throughout this repo will be random things I've built as little side learning
adventures. Things that didn't quite deserve their own repo, but needed a home. 
My hope is that this repo will serve as a log of things I've learned and terrible
code I've written. Perhaps one day I will return to one of this little projects and 
make them suck a little less.

### Projects I've finished
-[x] gocalc - A simple command line calculator that provides.... calculations 
-[] gotactoe - Tictactoe in Go. Pretty self explanatory

### Projects I'd like to start/work on
- Simple webserver to replace the crappy Nextjs implementation of [my personal site](https://corsini.io)
- A command line tool that could serve as a basic configuration script for my terminal. Would save me some time when I format my machine again (inevitably)
